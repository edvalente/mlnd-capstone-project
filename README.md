## Proposal

## Domain Background
In the city of Vitória (state of Espírito Santo, Brazil) there are numerous public health facilities. In these, the number of patients that don't attend to their medical appointments has reached nearly 30% from 2014 to 2015. This pattern is similar all over the country, so it isn't a local issue. This indice represents nearly R$20 million of public cash being wasted by appointments that result in no-shows, taking into account operational costs, SMS sent, confirmation call and employee's time. That's at least R$1 million monthly waste.


## Problem Statement

## Datasets and Inputs
The used dataset is available on Kaggle as version 3. I'll rewrite their names during the analysis for further clarity, with their updates registered in the dictionary between brackets ('[]'). It contains 300,000 observations and 15 variables (300000, 15), them being:
 - Age: integer, age of person to make the appointment [age]
 - Gender: categorical, gender of person to make the appointment, allowing either male or female [gender]
 - AppointmentRegistration: integer, the day the person asked for an appointment [app_registration]
 - AppointmentData: date, the day of the scheduled appointment [app_date]
 - DayOfTheWeek: categorical, the day of the week of the scheduled appointment [week_day]
 - Status: categorical label, indicating if the person showed up (show-up) or not (no-show) on the appointment [show-up]
 - Diabetes: categorical binary, whether the person has diabetes [diabetes]
 - Alcoolism: categorical binary, whether the person is an alcoholic [alcoholism]
 - HiperTension: categorical binary, whether the person has hypertension [hypertension]
 - Handcap: categorical binary, whether the person has a handicap [handicap]
 - Smokes: categorical binary, whether the person is a smoker [smokes]
 - Scholarship: categorical binary, whether the person recieves monetary help from the government, called 'Bolsa família' [monetary_help]
 - Tuberculosis: categorical binary, whether the person has tuberculosis [tuberculosis]
 - SMS_Reminder: categorical binary, whether the person has recieved an SMS reminder for the appointment one day before it [sms_reminder]
 - AwaitingTime: integer, days from appointment registration to scheduled appointment [days_to_appointment]

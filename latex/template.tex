    	\section{Objective:}
        
        Describe what you intend to do here, you can use a double backslash to make new lines if you want to, otherwise simply keep typing and Latex will take care of formatting things for you. \\
        
        \noindent Make sure that you include some good clear details

		\section{Rationale:}
        
        Why is this project important to you, and to others? What are you hoping to learn from it and how does it apply or relate to the NCS curriculum. 
        
	   	\section{Approach:}
        
        What is your method going to be? This doesn't have to be precise yet but give the reader a good idea of how you intend to go about doing what you propose. Will you research, will you design, perhaps an experiment, etc. 
        
    	\section{Timeline:}
        
        Give a bulleted timeline of when you will have things completed. Don't forget to include the Student Undergraduate Research Expo poster presentations, and final presentation in your timeline. \\
        
        \noindent You can create bullets by doing:
        
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item this is a bullet
            \item and this is a bullet
        \end{itemize}
        
    	\section{Possible Issues:}
        
        Tell the reader and me what possible issue might arise. These are issues with your knowledge base. Perhaps your not a programmer but you foresee programming as being part of this project. I will need to know these things so that I can best advise you.
